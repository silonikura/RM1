Population and Sample

Population

What do we measure? (variables, scales of measurement, and constructs)
variables (categorical, quantitative)
Characteristics, attributes, or conditions
that can take on different values (vary) or change
and that can be measured in our sample

categorical
	⁃	nominal, ordinal
	⁃	nominal: labeled and categorized qualities of a variable with no quantitative distinctions (ex. color: blue, green red)
	⁃	ordinal: Categories organized in an ordered sequence in terms of size or magnitude (ex. cool, warm, hot)
	⁃	indivisible categories
quantitative
	⁃	interval, ratio
	⁃	interval: Ordered categories that are all intervals of exactly the same size, arbitrary zero (zero degrees F provides indication of low temperature, but not an absence of temperature)
	⁃	ratio: An interval scale, but now has an absolute zero point, which indicates an absence of the variable. (ex. zero on a scale indicates an absence of weight)
Construct: 
an abstract attribute or characteristic that cannot be directly observed or measured but is thought to explain or predict behavior
Operational Defnition — A description of the construct of interest in terms of a specific procedure (set of operations) for measuring observable behavior (variable/s) (e.g. Happiness = Number of smiles per day)
